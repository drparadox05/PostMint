# 📰 PostMint — Writing, Tokenized.


## ✨ Overview

**PostMint** is a decentralized publishing platform where **every blog post or news article becomes a coin**.

Unlike platforms like Polymarket where users **bet on news**, PostMint lets readers **invest in the journalists** behind the news — and **own a piece of the content itself** through creator coins.

- ✍️ Publish stories, essays, or newsletters  
- 🪙 Automatically mint a creator coin when posting  
- 📈 Readers can invest in the creator's token  
- 🔁 Trade coins as creators gain traction and reputation

## 🎯 Project Goal

To empower independent writers, journalists, and creators by transforming content into **financially valuable, ownable, and tradable assets** using Zora’s open protocol.

This makes writing **speculative**, **rewarding**, and **on-chain**.

---

## 💡 Inspiration

> *Polymarket lets you bet on the news — PostMint lets you invest in the people who break it.*

We wanted to build a platform that supports long-term trust and rewards **truthful, insightful journalism**, not just short-term hype. Readers become investors. Writers become protocols.
